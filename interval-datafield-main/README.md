A datascreen useful for interval training. When I run hill intervals or sprint intervals, even "laps" are my efforts and odd "laps" are recoveries so I wanted a datascreen that shows different information on even & odd laps, even ones I need just the salient details of lap pace, lap duration, lap time and current heart rate. On the odd laps I can afford to spend longer looking at my watch so can show a more complicated screen including details of my fastest lap, lap number, total time & distance etc.
